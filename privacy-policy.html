  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 15th, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. What Data We Process</h2>
  <p>We only process the data you submit to the app to provide its core features, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyzing content from uploaded images to support quiz generation</li>
    <li>Generating quizzes based on the extracted content using AI services</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is processed temporarily and is not stored permanently, unless stated otherwise.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>To generate quizzes, we may transmit <strong>content extracted from your uploaded images</strong> to third-party AI services (e.g., Gemini by Google). We do not share the raw image, only the derived text or data.</p>
  <p>This sharing is required to enable the core functionality of the app.</p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We serve ads through providers such as Google AdMob, which may collect the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers</li>
    <li>Approximate location data</li>
    <li>Usage statistics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers may use cookies or other tracking technologies. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>By using the app, you consent to this data collection.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>Uploaded images and any derived content are automatically deleted from our servers within 48 hours. If you wish to request earlier deletion, contact us at <a href="mailto:help@quizuma.com">help@quizuma.com</a> and provide your session ID if available.</p>

  <h2>5. Future Features</h2>
  <p>We plan to allow users to optionally store their quizzes in the cloud. When this becomes available:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It will be opt-in</li>
    <li>You’ll receive a unique code to manage or delete your stored data</li>
    <li>Data will be stored anonymously</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. No Behavioral Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal analytics or track user behavior, outside of what is required for advertising and core app functionality.</p>

  <h2>7. Sensitive Content</h2>
  <p>Please do not upload confidential or sensitive personal information. You are responsible for the content you submit.</p>

  <h2>8. Legal Basis</h2>
  <p>We process your data based on <strong>legitimate interest</strong> and, where applicable, <strong>your explicit consent</strong>, in line with GDPR and related regulations.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, contact us at: <a href="mailto:help@quizuma.com">help@quizuma.com</a></p>
